            <h3>Why do I wish to be your Parish Councillor?</h3>
            <p>Our community has undergone significant changes including the threat of HS and the addition of many new homes, with further developments potentially coming soon. I myself have observed issues firsthand including the skate park development and unfinished local infrastructure on the Redrow Estate. I am aware of the safety concerns in the lack of a pedestrian crossing on Tixall Road and the need for better maintenance of green spaces across the whole wider parish. It is my understanding that residents have concerns about the speeds of cars on many of our roads and are frustrated by the badly managed potholes reported and still not repaired to an adequate and safe standard. I am focused in understanding the impact of the SERCO project and wish to seek opportunities to mitigate negative outcomes to the community. I am keen to engaged with the whole community and explore opportunities in how we can develop our Village Hall to become a hub of community engagement for our parish. These are all critical areas that I would aim to address as a councillor and if successful in appointment would be eager to hear from all across our community about their concerns and desires for our parish in the future.</p>
